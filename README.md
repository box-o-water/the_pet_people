## Description

One major barrier to pet adoption is how hard it is to find pet-friendly rental properties. Our group wanted to find a way to ease this process - especially for responsible pet owners.

To that end, we developed an application for renters and landlords to collaborate to create a reference, via profiles and reviews, for potential new landlords.
