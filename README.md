# The Pet People

  ## Description
  One major barrier to pet adoption is how hard it is to find rental properties that allow pets. Our group wanted to find a way to ease the process of finding a place to rent that allows pets - especially for people who have shown themselves to be responsible pet owners. 
  
  To that end, we created an application for renters and landlords to create profiles and leave reviews or recommendations for renters and properties/landlords. An app would allow a renter to easily provide references and positive reviews from previous landlords and for renters to leave positive reviews for landlords.
